# Nettoken OmniAuth Strategy

This gem provides a simple way to authenticate to Nettoken Web API using OmniAuth with OAuth2.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-nettoken', :git => "git://github.com/goodviber/nettoken-strategy.git" 

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## OmniAuth

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Nettoken` is an Omniauth strategy. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

## Usage

You'll need to register an app on Nettoken, you can do this here - https://oauth.nettoken.co.uk/developers/apps

Usage of the gem is very similar to other OmniAuth strategies.
You'll need to add your app credentials to `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :nettoken, 'app_id', 'app_secret'
end
```

Or with Devise in `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

```ruby
config.omniauth :nettoken, 'app_id', 'app_secret'
```

## Auth Hash

Sample *Auth Hash* from `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  "provider" => "nettoken",
  "uid" => 2,
  "info"=> {
    "email "=> "jwbradley87@gmail.com"
  },
  "credentials"=> {
    "token" => "fa703d7c5a205db6ef273bd8985bb29608c1123d956c7c273a2f3bbb37eb4bd6",
    "expires_at" => 1468263959,
    "expires"=>true
  },
  "extra"=> {}
}
```
